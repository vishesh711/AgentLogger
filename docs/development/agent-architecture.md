# Agent-Based Architecture for AgentLogger

This document outlines a design for evolving AgentLogger into a true multi-agent system for autonomous code debugging and fixing.

## Overview

The current AgentLogger system uses AI to analyze code, explain errors, and generate fixes, but operates in a relatively linear fashion with limited autonomous capabilities. This design proposes transforming AgentLogger into a system of specialized, cooperative agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex debugging workflows autonomously.

## Core Agent Types

### 1. Coordinator Agent

The Coordinator Agent serves as the orchestrator of the entire debugging process.

**Responsibilities:**
- Interpret user requests and determine the appropriate workflow
- Coordinate the activities of specialized agents
- Maintain the overall state of the debugging process
- Make high-level decisions about strategy
- Report progress and results back to the user

**Implementation:**
- Uses a planning system to create and adjust workflows
- Maintains a memory of the current debugging session
- Has access to all specialized agents as tools

### 2. Analyzer Agent

The Analyzer Agent focuses on understanding code and identifying issues.

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse and analyze code structure
- Identify potential bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells
- Classify issues by type, severity, and confidence
- Provide detailed context for each identified issue

**Implementation:**
- Combines static analysis tools with LLM-based reasoning
- Uses a specialized prompt template focused on code analysis
- Can execute targeted code segments in sandbox environments
- Maintains a knowledge base of common bug patterns

### 3. Explainer Agent

The Explainer Agent specializes in interpreting error messages and explaining issues in human terms.

**Responsibilities:**
- Translate technical error messages into clear explanations
- Provide context about why an issue occurs
- Explain potential implications of the issue
- Suggest general approaches for fixing

**Implementation:**
- Uses templates for common error types
- Has access to documentation and best practices
- Can generate visualizations to explain complex issues

### 4. Fix Generator Agent

The Fix Generator Agent creates solutions for identified issues.

**Responsibilities:**
- Design potential fixes for identified issues
- Generate code patches
- Evaluate multiple solution approaches
- Consider edge cases and potential side effects

**Implementation:**
- Uses a specialized code generation model
- Maintains a library of common fix patterns
- Can generate multiple alternative solutions
- Reasons about code context beyond the immediate issue

### 5. Test Agent

The Test Agent validates proposed fixes.

**Responsibilities:**
- Create test cases for the issue and fix
- Execute tests in sandbox environments
- Verify that fixes resolve the original issue
- Check for regressions or new issues introduced by fixes

**Implementation:**
- Can generate unit tests automatically
- Uses sandbox execution for safety
- Tracks test results and coverage
- Can perform fuzzing and edge case testing

### 6. PR Agent

The PR Agent handles GitHub integration and pull request management.

**Responsibilities:**
- Create branches and commits
- Format and submit pull requests
- Respond to feedback on PRs
- Update PRs based on review comments

**Implementation:**
- Integrates with GitHub API
- Formats commit messages and PR descriptions
- Can interpret and respond to review comments
- Follows project-specific PR templates and conventions

## Agent Communication and Workflow

Agents communicate through a structured message passing system:

1. **Message Format**: JSON objects with fields for:
   - Message type (request, response, notification)
   - Sender and recipient agent IDs
   - Content (structured data relevant to the message)
   - Metadata (timestamps, message IDs, etc.)

2. **Workflow Example**:
   ```
   User Request → Coordinator Agent
                  ↓
   Coordinator creates plan and delegates
                  ↓
   Analyzer Agent ← → Explainer Agent
                  ↓
   Fix Generator Agent
                  ↓
   Test Agent
                  ↓
   PR Agent
                  ↓
   Coordinator Agent → User Response
   ```

3. **State Management**: Each debugging session maintains a state object that tracks:
   - Original code and context
   - Identified issues
   - Generated explanations
   - Proposed fixes
   - Test results
   - PR status

## Agent Implementation

Each agent will be implemented as a class with:

1. **Core Logic**: Python functions implementing the agent's specific capabilities
2. **LLM Integration**: Prompt templates and response parsers
3. **Tool Access**: Methods to call external tools and APIs
4. **Memory**: State tracking for the agent's specific domain
5. **Communication Interface**: Methods to send and receive messages

Example agent class structure:

```python
class AnalyzerAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm_client, tools):
        self.llm_client = llm_client
        self.tools = tools
        self.memory = {}
        
    async def process_message(self, message):
        # Process incoming message
        # ...
        
    async def analyze_code(self, code, language):
        # Analyze code for issues
        # ...
        
    async def classify_issue(self, issue):
        # Classify the type and severity of an issue
        # ...
```

## System Architecture

The overall system architecture consists of:

1. **Agent Layer**: The specialized agents described above
2. **Orchestration Layer**: Manages agent communication and workflow execution
3. **Tool Layer**: External tools and APIs that agents can use
4. **Storage Layer**: Databases for persistent storage of debugging sessions
5. **API Layer**: REST API for user interaction

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Agent Framework
- Implement the base agent class and communication system
- Create the Coordinator Agent with basic planning capabilities
- Develop the agent state management system

### Phase 2: Specialized Agents
- Implement the Analyzer Agent
- Implement the Explainer Agent
- Implement the Fix Generator Agent

### Phase 3: Testing and Integration

- Implement collaborative debugging with multiple agents
- Add support for more languages and frameworks

## Evaluation Metrics

The agent system will be evaluated on:

1. **Autonomy**: Ability to solve issues with minimal human intervention
2. **Success Rate**: Percentage of bugs successfully fixed
3. **Solution Quality**: Quality of generated fixes (correctness, efficiency, readability)
4. **Explanation Quality**: Clarity and accuracy of explanations
5. **Time Efficiency**: Time to generate and validate fixes

## Technical Requirements

- **LLM Integration**: Advanced integration with models like GPT-4, Claude, or Llama 3
- **Tool Use**: Framework for agents to use external tools
- **Sandboxing**: Secure execution environment for testing code
- **State Management**: Efficient tracking of debugging session state

## Conclusion

This agent-based architecture transforms AgentLogger from an AI-assisted tool into a truly autonomous debugging system. By decomposing the debugging process into specialized agents, the system can handle more complex bugs, provide better explanations, and generate higher-quality fixes while maintaining a coherent workflow.
