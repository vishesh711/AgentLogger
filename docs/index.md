## Architecture

AgentLogger is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. The application uses an agent-based architecture where specialized AI agents work together to analyze code, identify issues, and generate fixes. The system uses PostgreSQL for data storage and can optionally use Redis for caching. The AI capabilities are powered by the Groq API.
