I'll help you create comprehensive documentation that covers all the different ways to run AgentLogger. Let me update the existing documentation and create new guides for different deployment scenarios.

First, let me check the current documentation structure:
Ran tool

Great! I can see there are already some guides. Let me update the main installation guide and create a comprehensive deployment guide that covers all methods. First, let me check the current installation guide:
Read file: docs/guides/installation.md
Now let me create a comprehensive deployment guide that covers all methods. I'll update the existing installation.md and create a new comprehensive deployment guide:
Now let me also update the main getting started guide to be more comprehensive:
Read file: docs/guides/getting-started.md
Now let me create a comprehensive deployment guide that covers all deployment scenarios:
Let me read the current deployment guide first to see what needs updating:
Read file: docs/guides/deployment.md
I can see the deployment guide is already quite comprehensive. Let me also create a simple README update that provides quick start instructions. Let me check the current README:
Read file: README.md
Now let me create a comprehensive quick run guide by updating the getting started section:
Let me replace the content properly:
Let me read the full getting started file to see its current structure:
Read file: docs/guides/getting-started.md
Great! I can see the getting started guide has already been updated with comprehensive information. Let me now create a concise "How to Run" guide and update the main README with a clear deployment section. Let me also create a simple quick reference guide:
Now let me update the main README with a clear and comprehensive "How to Run" section:
Now let me create a comprehensive development guide that shows all the different ways to run AgentLogger for development:
Let me check if the development setup guide exists and what its current content is:
Read file: docs/development/development-setup.md
Great! I can see the development setup guide already exists and is comprehensive. Now let me create a simple "run commands" quick reference. Let me check if there's a development index:
Read file: docs/development/index.md
Now let me create a comprehensive summary by updating the main documentation index:
Read file: docs/index.md
Perfect! Now let me create a quick summary by running the application and showing the user how everything works. Let me also create a simple "Quick Commands" reference file:
Let me create the file differently:
```bash
touch QUICK_START.md
```
Let me write content to the file using a different approach:
```bash
cat > QUICK_START.md << 'EOF'
# AgentLogger - Quick Start Reference

⚡ Get AgentLogger running in under 2 minutes with any of these methods!

## 🐳 Docker (Recommended) - 30 seconds

  -d '{"code": "print(hello world)", "language": "python"}'

# Test via web interface
# Go to http://localhost/playground and paste buggy code
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check services
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Reset everything
docker-compose down && docker system prune -f && docker-compose up -d
```
